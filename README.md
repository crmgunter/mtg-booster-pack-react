This app makes front end calls to the Magic the Gathering API to grab MTG sets and create booster packs of a specific number of cards based on the expansion selected. Eventually I'd like to set up a draft simulation type deal. 

It's a react app using axios for api calls.

Not much going on with styling but I did pull in styled components for the little bit of styling there is.
